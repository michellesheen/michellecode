        <h2>Romance isekai manhwas: 
            Challenging or Reifying Notions of “Koreanness”? </h2>
    </div>


    <div>
        <div>
            <div class="sub"><h3>⋆ INTRODUCTION ⋆</h3></div>

            <p>Isekai manhwa literally translates to “other world” and refers to a genre of manhwa (Korean comic) that follows tropes in which the main character is reincarnated in another world different from their own. As a ubiquitous genre of manhwas with trademark art styles, settings, character archetypes, and storylines, romance isekai manhwas have especially witnessed a rise in popularity within the past years with its primary fan base being younger female readers.  
            </p>

            <p>At this point, the Korean manhwa industry might be credited for spearheading the popularization of the romance isekai genre. In fact, popular manhwa sites displaying the top-rated manhwa are a testament to the overwhelming popularity of specifically Korean works within the genre. However, transfers of cultural products over history come into stark contrast with such a notion, unsettling the idea that these manhwas are purely Korean products. With influences from European eras from centuries past and the manga industry that serves as a reference point, romance isekai manhwa is a culturally hybrid product. From art styles to character dialogue and the history of the genre itself, popular works problematize commonly held notions that the genre exemplifies “Koreanness” as a cultural product. 
            </p>

            <p>In this paper, I intend to ask the question of what hegemonies manhwas simultaneously destabilize and reinforce. What can isekai romance manhwas reveal about the transfer and subsequent domestication of cultural products in the context of South Korea? What does this reveal about globalization and the solidification and/or resistance of systems of power? I argue that the romance isekai manhwa genre diverges from typical representations of "Koreanness," and the employment of a fantastical setting effectively creates alternative modes of thinking about the contemporary world, particularly by allowing female characters greater agency. However, in many manhwas, such portrayals of agency are flawed, as they appear to be conditional and contingent upon how closely characters align with hegemonic beauty standards.

            <div class="sub"><h3>⋆ HOW “KOREAN” IS THE ROMANCE ISEKAI MANHWA GENRE? ⋆</h3></div>
            
            <p>In “The Birth of ‘Rok,’” Kim and Shin define glocalization and hybridization in the context of the Korean music industry, which largely morphed through a process in which the “global encountered the local, power blended with resistance, and mimesis turned into creation”. Glocalization and hybridization go hand-in-hand as the former refers to how global messages are “interpreted and recreated” in the context of a local setting while the latter refers more generally to a “global melange of national, subnational and supranational cultures and agencies”. U.S. military bases of the era became an entryway for American music genres to seep into Korea through camp shows and other forms of musical entertainment and played a role in shaping the musical practices in an evolving South Korea. This intermingling of Western culture with the local culture brought with it new types of musical performances, which became a point of contention as it unsettled notions of femininity and masculinity at the time. For example, combining kayo and pop, The Pearl Sisters shook the “Confucian ideal image” of Korean women (Kim et. al, 213). Deeming such music vulgar, the Park Chung-hee regime began its purge by first claiming to wipe out waesaek music but broadened this censorship to anything they deemed “inappropriate,” most of which was popular music among youth. The deployment of an argument that calls on the protection of a pure Korean national culture emboldened the government to carry out acts of censorship under an authoritarian regime. This contention between the government and popular culture signifies the importance of questioning narratives of national identity. Kim and Shin raise the question of what constitutes an authentic national culture. After all, “the line drawn between alien and national culture is blurry, even arbitrary, for national culture is itself a suspect notion”. 
            </p>

            <p>Such nationalistic sentiment, in an effort to safeguard and insulate South Korean national culture, carries over in the decades following the Park regime’s vilification of waesaek and into other cultural products like the Korean manhwa. Even after the 1998 Joint Agreement between South Korea and Japan, which reaffirmed friendly relations between the two countries while lifting restrictions on Japanese products, South Korea continued to hold a nationalistic approach to crafting cultural products, especially with manhwas and animation. Koh notes the paradoxical relationship of the simultaneous effort toward creating a distinct national manhwa while taking the influence from Japanese manga. In fact, “the Korean government’s policy toward Japanese manga had the dual purpose of using the influences of Japanese creative resources for the development of the Korean cartoon and animation industries as well as of protecting the domestic artists and industry from their Japanese counterparts”. Returning to Kim and Shin’s analysis of the glocalization of Western music, while examinations of the past reveal that popular music forms, such as rock in South Korea, are imbricated with a militarized and imperial history, the idea that such adaptations of Western cultural forms are examples of one-directional cultural imperialism is an incomplete analysis as cultural influences are multi-directional. It is crucial to note the origins and influences shaping romance isekai manhwas, but there is also no doubt that the Korean manhwa industry works to blend — and hybridize — tropes and forms of storytelling to create new products which are then integrated by the rest of a hybridizing world in a cyclical process. Manhwas within the romance isekai genre, in particular, reveal such hybridization in adapting aspects from various points of reference (such as Japanese manga) to construct a recognizable manhwa format that is trademarked as a Korean one. However, it is worthwhile to note that “Koreanness” is represented rather differently across cultural products with manhwa being more covert in their allusions to “Koreanness.”</p>

            <div class="sub"><h3>⋆ CHALLENGING OR REIFYING “KOREANNESS”? ⋆</h3></div>
            

            <p>Although the isekai romance comic genre may typically be identified as being a largely Korean product, the contents within these manhwas defy the expectations of representing the stereotypical “Koreanness” present in other cultural products. This lack of obvious “Koreanness” can be noted through the absence of typical cultural motifs; instead, most nods to the Korean origins of these manhwas are only ever allusions to the “real world” that the female main character originates from. The settings that female main characters reincarnate can typically be inferred to be the modern South Korea of today as they are plagued with worries such as burdening excessive finances and suffering from ostracization by family, friends, and a larger society. They even tend to exaggerate such sufferings, which some readers are seen to intentionally seek out (see Figure 1). 
            </p>

            <p>On the other hand, K-pop is a cultural product that faces greater expectations to represent a more overt “Koreanness.” When comparing K-pop to manhwas — specifically those falling within the romance isekai genre — the latter clearly does not have to align with an expectation to conform to the same standards. Oftentimes, K-pop acts are faced with scrutiny over the visibility/invisibility of what the public may deem as being an “authentic” representation of “Koreanness.” Take BTS’s “IDOL” for example. As analyzed by Rita Rongyi Lin in “Plastic Orientalism: Surface Logic and Cultural Technique in K-Pop,” the “IDOL” music video is characterized by gaudy colors, computer-generated imagery of gyeongbokgung, the sound of Korean folk instruments, and lyrics that directly reference the self-determination of the K-pop idol identity. The imagery and musical qualities of “IDOL” act as excess and irony that clap back at the notion of a “correct Koreanness” as expected by audiences. Through such plasticity, Lin establishes that BTS reclaims their Korean pop idol identity as their own. 
            </p>

            <p>Romance isekai manhwas do not rely on the orientalist tropes that are expected of other Korean cultural products like K-pop acts. Rather, "Koreanness" is most commonly imbued through the experiences that reincarnated characters draw from. For example, in the popular manhwa "Kill the Villainess," the main character Eris's struggles reflect the societal norms and hardships of the South Korean working class as she alludes to moments in her life “back home” when she could not even afford convenience store food. Her past life, which she is working toward returning to, comes into stark contrast with the extravagant life she is suddenly born into when she reincarnates as a villainous side character in the romance novel she had been reading (Figure 2). 
            </p>

            <p>For consumers of Korean manhwa, the recognition of romance isekai manhwas as distinctly Korean cultural products is contingent upon the reader's familiarity with these societal norms and tropes. Therefore, the deliberate choice to employ settings reminiscent of Western European eras may serve as a strategy to bypass the audience’s expectation of a manhwa adhering to traditional Korean aesthetics that are deemed “truly Korean.” The high fantasy genre affords greater narrative flexibility, enabling creators to explore diverse themes without constantly having to prove their authenticity as a Korean cultural product. Consequently, manhwa creators within this genre can subtly integrate elements of Koreanness, such as the depiction of common hardships experienced by the Korean working class.

            <div class="sub"><h3>⋆ THE “GIRLBOSS” MAIN CHARACTER ARCHETYPE ⋆</h3></div>
            

            <p>Another aspect that distinguishes romance isekai manhwa from other genres and Korean cultural products is the deliberate choice of settings. While the settings of manhwas may play a role in bypassing and challenging the commonly held notion of a “correct Koreanness,” they simultaneously pander to Western hegemony by excessively and solely drawing inspiration from Western European eras and aesthetics. This approach continues to reify traditional gender roles while disguised as narratives featuring strong female protagonists.
            </p>

            <p>Isekai romance manhwas are characterized by similar settings, architecture, systems of power, and character archetypes that make manhwas easily distinguishable from other genres. For example, the settings of many works are “reminiscent of medieval Europe”, drawing from the Tudor era, Georgian era, Victorian era, etc., or even being an amalgamation of all of these historical Western European eras (see Figure 3). 
            </p>

            <p>Despite isekai romance manhwas taking inspiration from the extravagant aesthetics of these European time periods — a romanticized perception of a “lavish” past — readers and fans have commented on such manhwas’ inconsistencies in correctly portraying these eras by failing to represent certain cultural elements such as attire of these characters (see Figure 4). Common character archetypes exemplify an “[association of] modernity with the West,” which Michelle Cho identifies as being a legacy of the nation’s colonial history. Although set in the past, centuries from today, these manhwas work to portray Western civilizations of the past as a form of escape from the bleak South Korean society portrayed in the manhwas. The constant jumping between a modern South Korean world and a historic ambiguously European world establishes the West as a haven in comparison to the East, or South Korea.  
            </p>

            <p>Although no statistic reveals the demographics of the primary audience consuming romance isekai manhwas, inferences about the consumption of romance novels, in general, can help conclude that women make up a bulk of this readership. As of a study in 2017, 82% of romance novel readers are women, oftentimes described as “voracious” readers. The popularity of the genre is credited to the fact that romance novels allow women to fantasize about situations that would be difficult to come by in the real world as they “enable women imaginatively to resist the constraints and excesses of a male-dominated society, and to find a cathartic space in which to explore fear and guilt, as well as revenge fantasies, around fathers and husbands.” On a similar note, as lighthearted and frivolous as the romance isekai genre may seem, it plays a similar role as romance novels in allowing women a space to escape and imagine alternative roles where they hold more agency in determining their fates. This allows for a link in which reincarnation from the real, modern world (which mirrors the world from which the reader is situated), is easy to place oneself into the shoes of the female protagonist. Through this projection, readers “escape” to another world, leaving behind a monotonous life for a romanticized version of the world to which the reincarnated female protagonist is displaced. 	
            </p>

            <p>It is important to note that these female characters are depicted as “girlboss” figures who defy established storylines and resist “fate,” challenging societal standards and expectations of women within a conservative historical fantasy world. Despite their rejection of conventional primness and their assertive personalities, which highlight their agency and self-determination, these characters remain confined within a heteronormative hegemonic framework of womanhood that consistently limits their abilities and choices. For example, these manhwas lack a diversity of female main characters as they fall into similar beauty standards reflective of the real world. Most characters within the genre embody typically non-East Asian (and often European) features while conforming to beauty standards prevalent in South Korea. Female characters are frequently depicted as light-skinned, slim, and possessing distinct hair colors such as golden, pink, or blue (See Figure 5). While the vibrant and atypical hair colors worn by the reincarnated female main characters suggest the non-conformity of these characters, especially serving as a contrast to the world from which they are reincarnating, they fail to establish the same non-conformity in all other aspects of the beauty standard. Ultimately, although “girl power” is emphasized in the female main characters of romance isekai manhwa, it serves merely as a secondary plot device disguised as agency without fundamentally altering the narrative structure. This structure typically follows a pattern of (1) denial, (2) acceptance, and (3) a “happily ever after” ending, wherein other abusive or malevolent characters are granted redemption and the female main character is satisfied with remaining in the conditions of the manhwa that she previously found a problem with. 
            </p>

            <p>The selective representation of individuals as “girlboss” characters only when they conform to established beauty standards poses a significant issue, as it seeks not to dismantle hegemony but rather to reinforce beauty standards. This commodification of such identity is a problem that Patty Ahn addresses in her examination of a Dodo commercial featuring Korean model Harisu, who garnered substantial attention for being transgender. The commercial “spotlit [Harisu’s] transsexual identity [to serve] the entrepreneurial goal of attracting attention to a brand struggling to compete in a vigorous market”. Harisu’s representation in the media, although portrayed as progressive, given the little visibility of transgender figures in the South choosing media at the time, is misleading because of the selectivity of the commercial in deliberately choosing a single person aligning with beauty standards to represent the queer—specifically transgender—community. Similarly, the female main character archetype of a “strong” protagonist appears empowering on the surface but fails to resist the systems of power that conform to traditional beauty standards. This approach continues to reify beauty standards and, in effect, creates a hegemony that requires women to align with certain beauty standards as a prerequisite for obtaining agency.

            <div class="sub"><h3>⋆ CONCLUSION ⋆</h3></div>
            
            <p>Romance isekai manhwas are distinct from other touted cultural products of South Korea like K-pop for its more covert representation of a notion of “Koreanness.” By examining the transfer and domestication of cultural products in South Korea, it becomes evident that this genre of manhwa challenges traditional representations of “Koreanness” through their fantastical settings and narratives as they craft a unique space for reimagining contemporary societal norms, particularly by granting female characters greater agency. However, this agency is often conditional, as it remains tied to hegemonic beauty standards that perpetuate traditional gender roles and societal expectations. While romance isekai manhwas offer a space for alternative modes of thinking and greater female empowerment, they also reveal the limitations imposed by prevailing beauty standards and the selective representation of “strong” female protagonists.
